## Troubleshooting

### Rate Limiting
If you see a 429 error, you've hit the incident.io API rate limit. The server will log rate limit headers to help you understand when you can retry.

### 404 Errors
If you get 404 errors when using certain tools:
- Verify the incident ID exists
- Check that your API key has the necessary permissions
- Ensure you're using valid IDs for roles, users, and other entities
